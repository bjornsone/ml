## Machine Learning Introduction

<b>Training in Tensorflow</b>

* [Predicting Text](demo_text_prediction.ipynb) - Trains a LSTM to predict subsequent characters 
* [Character Recognition](intro_tensorflow_learning.ipynb) - Training of a simple NN for mnist character recognition using foundational Tensorflow

<b>Tensorflow Basic Functions</b>

* [Mandelbrot Graphing](mandelbrot.ipynb) - improves upon a Mandelbrot demo from tesnorflow.org
* [Introduction to Tensorflow](intro_tensorflow.ipynb) - demonstrates basic functions of Tensorflow
* [Variable Names and Scope](variable_names.ipynb) - creates variables and lists variables with scope
* [Shaping and Slicing Tensors](shaping_tensors.ipynb) - demonstrates functions for slicing and dicing tensors
* [Fitting a Line](line_fit.ipynb) - uses gradient descent to find the best fit line
* [Activation Functions](demo_activation_functions.ipynb) - plots several Tensorflow activation functions
